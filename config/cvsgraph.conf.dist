# CvsGraph configuration
#
# - Empty lines and whitespace are ignored.
#
# - Comments start with '#' and everything until
#   end of line is ignored.
#
# - Strings are C-style strings in which characters
#   may be escaped with '\' and written in octal
#   and hex escapes. Note that '\' must be escaped
#   if it is to be entered as a character.
#
# - Some strings are expanded with printf like
#   conversions which start with '%'. Not all
#   are applicable at all times, in which case they
#   will expand to noting.
#   %c = cvsroot (with trailing '/')
#   %C = cvsroot (*without* trailing '/')
#   %m = module (with trailing '/')
#   %M = module (*without* trailing '/')
#   %f = filename without path
#   %F = filename without path and with ",v" stripped
#   %p = path part of filename (with trailing '/')
#   %r = number of revisions
#   %b = number of branches
#   %% = '%'
#   %R = the revision number (e.g. '1.2.4.4')
#   %P = previous revision number
#   %B = the branch number (e.g. '1.2.4')

#   %a = author of revision
#   %s = state of revision
#   %t = current tag of branch or revision

#
# - Numbers may be entered as octal, decimal or
#   hex as in 0117, 79 and 0x4f respectively.
