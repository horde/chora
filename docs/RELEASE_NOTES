The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Chora
Repository Viewer version H3 (2.0).

Chora is built upon the Horde Application Framework and provides a read-only
browser interface to any number of version control repositories.  Advanced
features include a visual branch view of the repository's history,
pretty-printed output, annotation, patchsets and basic statistics.

The major changes compared to the Chora 1.x versions are:
    * Subversion support
    * Patchset information
    * Cvsgraph integration
    * Simple commit statistics
    * Access keys.
    * mod_rewrite support for prettier URLs.
